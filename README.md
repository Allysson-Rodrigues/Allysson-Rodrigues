### Engineering Philosophy
Efficiency is a product of restriction. In software engineering, hardware abundance is not a justification for inefficient code. As a researcher and developer, I focus on building resilient, high-performance backend architectures that remain robust under any infrastructure conditions.

I am currently building my foundation in **Node.js** and programming logic, documenting my technical evolution through systematic exploration and implementation.

### Agentic Workspace & Workflow
I operate an advanced agentic environment designed for maximum developer productivity and autonomous research. My current setup is focused on:

- **Antigravity Framework**: A specialized agent kit for advanced autonomous coding and knowledge synthesis.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Integration of specialized servers (GitHub, SQLite, Search) to extend LLM capabilities into local and remote environments.
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Utilizing PARA methodology integrated with a local JSON memory layer for long-term project context retention.
